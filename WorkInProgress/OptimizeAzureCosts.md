**For the fourth year running, cost optimization is the top cloud initiative according to [Flexera’s 2020 State of the Cloud Report](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Finfo.flexera.com%2FSLO-CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud-2020&data=01|01|liz.wolk@rationalcx.com|5233df554f854dc1297808d8028206fa|03f0126b518e456cbac9346c34f95bd9|1&sdata=ec2vPJFMaaaEsuUeFNfUy0gEwd2RttT0ilj560p%2BSiE%3D&reserved=0)**

Today, we’ll cover the Azure tools, offers, and guidance that can help you manage and optimize your cloud costs. You’ll learn how to understand and forecast your bill, cost optimize your workload, and control your spending. Then we’ll show you seven things you can do today to optimize your cloud costs and start saving.

## Understand and forecast your costs

To manage and optimize your Azure costs, you first need to understand what you’re spending now and forecast what your bill is likely to be in the future for your current and planned projects.

[Azure Cost Management + Billing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cost-management/) gives you a full set of cloud cost management capabilities. You can use Cost Management + Billing to:

- Monitor and analyze your Azure bill.
- Set budgets and spending alerts.
- Allocate costs to your teams and projects.

As you embark on new priority workloads or revisit existing workloads for cost optimization opportunities, you’ll want to estimate the costs involved. Cost Management + Billing surfaces rich operational and financial insights, including cost forecasts. In addition, the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/) and [Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/tco/calculator/) can help you estimate costs for your next Azure projects.

 

## Cost optimize your workloads

Once you have a better understanding of your spending now and in the future, you can focus on cost optimizing your Azure resources and workloads. In this area, [Azure Advisor](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/advisor/) and the [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://aka.ms/theframework) are our primary optimization tools, while key Azure offers and licensing terms, like the Azure Hybrid Benefit and Azure Reservations can help you realize significant savings.

Azure Advisor helps you cost optimize your Azure resources with [personalized best practice recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-cost-recommendations) based on your configurations and usage data. For example, Azure Advisor can help you identify unused resources like idle virtual machines (VMs) and find opportunities to right-size resources like SQL databases.

The Azure Well-Architected Framework provides guidance and best practices at a broader architectural level to help you cost optimize your workloads. You can also take the [Azure Well-Architected Review](https://aka.ms/thereview) to assess your current or planned workloads from a cost perspective to get tailored recommendations on how to improve.

In addition, Azure offers and licensing terms can make a big difference when it comes to cost savings including:

- [Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/hybrid-benefit/): AWS is five times more expensive than Azure for Windows Server and SQL Server. Save when you migrate your on-premises workloads to Azure.
- [Azure Reservations](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/reservations/): Get a discount of up to 72 percent over pay-as-you-go pricing on Azure services when you prepay for a one- or three-year term with reservation pricing.
- [Azure Spot Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/spot/): Utilize unused Azure compute capacity at deep discounts—up to 90 percent compared to pay-as-you-go prices.
- [Azure Dev/Test Pricing:](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/dev-test/) Take advantage of significant rate discounts for your ongoing development and testing—and avoid paying Microsoft software charges on your VMs.

## Control your costs

Finally, you’ll want to put in place organization-wide cost management policies and guardrails, so you can free up your teams to go fast while keeping your costs under control.

For many customers, governing cost is a major concern when it comes to the cloud. Balancing workload requirements like performance demands and reliability needs with cloud costs can be challenging, especially during times of business transformation like we see today. The [Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure](https://aka.ms/adopt) provides [organizational cost management guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/govern/cost-management/) as part of a cloud governance strategy. This guidance can help mitigate cloud spending risks through cost management best practices.

Once you’ve set your organizational policies for cost management, you can implement these cost controls and guardrails directly in your Azure environment with [Azure Policy](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-policy/) to achieve real-time cloud compliance at scale.
